# Rock vs Mine Prediction – Binary Classification using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised learning to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a sonar signal is reflecting off a **rock** or a **mine**.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply basic machine learning techniques and data preprocessing methods to classify sonar returns using numerical signal strength features.

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name:** Sonar Dataset  
- **Features:** 60 numeric attributes representing energy of sonar signals  
- **Target:** `R` for Rock and `M` for Mine

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Model Building Highlights

- Data loading and inspection  
- Correlation heatmap and basic EDA  
- Train-test split  
- Model training with Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy score and prediction validation

## ✅ Project Status

Completed as part of my Machine Learning fundamentals practice.  
Future improvements include testing with other classifiers (KNN, SVM, Random Forest).
